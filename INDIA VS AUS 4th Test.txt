The fourth Test match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy was an exciting one. Sam Konstas, a debutant, played aggressively from the start. A physical
altercation between Virat Kohli and Sam Konstas marked the opening morning of the Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Sam attempted a sweep and
three reverse sweeps in the same over bowled by Jasprit Bumrah.And succeeded three times.The fifth day was even more thrilling. India, chasing a 
target of 340, had lost four wickets by the end of the second session. They needed to survive just one more session with six wickets in hand. Travis Head
came to bowl and provided the breakthrough by dismissing Rishabh Pant. Suddenly, India began losing wickets at regular intervals and 
couldn't survive the final session.
Yashasvi Jaiswal was initially given not out, but Australia reviewed the decision, and the third umpire overturned the on-field call. This decision stirred
controversy, as UltraEdge did not show conclusive evidence to overturn the decision. However, the ball's deviation and replays suggesting it had touched
both the bat and gloves before being caught by Alex Carey were considered sufficient evidence for the reversal.This match was a thrilling display of
cricket, filled with excitement, aggression, controversy, and intense moments both on and off the field.
